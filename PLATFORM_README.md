## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/UIDickinson/ritual-pm.git
cd ritual-pm
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env.local` file with:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

4. Set up the database:
- Run the SQL schema from `database/schema.sql` in your Supabase project
- This creates all necessary tables, functions, and triggers

This creates:
- Admin user (username: `admin`, password: `admin123`)
